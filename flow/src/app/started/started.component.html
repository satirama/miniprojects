      <p>Flow is a static type checker for your JavaScript code. It does a lot of work to make you more productive. Making you code faster,
          smarter, more confidently, and to a bigger scale.<br><br>
      Flow checks your code for errors through <span class="font-weight-bold">static type annotations.</span> These types allow you to tell Flow how you want your code to work, 
      and Flow will make sure it does work that way.

      <p>Because Flow understands JavaScript so well, it doesnâ€™t need many of these 
        types. You should only ever have to do a minimal amount of work to describe 
        your code to Flow and it will infer the rest. A lot of the time, 
        Flow can understand your code without any types at all.</p>

      <p>You can also adopt Flow incrementally and easily remove it at anytime, 
        so you can try Flow out on any codebase and see how you like it.</p>
